AI-Powered Budgeting App
Overview:

This project aims to build a budgeting application enhanced with the power of AI using the OpenAI API. Currently, the core codebase is in Python, but there are plans to transition this into a fully-fledged web application with the integration of Django, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The ambition doesn't stop there. Once deployed online, this app will also support a robust database system to store user data, enabling features like registration, income, and expense tracking for each user.

Features:

User Registration & Login: Securely register a new user or log in to access your budgeting information.
Income & Expense Tracking: Users can input monthly income and add expenses categorized by type (e.g. Rent, Food).
Budget Overview: A concise view of monthly income, categorized expenses, and the remaining budget.
AI-Powered Financial Suggestions: Get personalized financial advice based on your income and expenditure trends using OpenAI.
Technical Details:

Python: Used as the primary programming language for logic and data manipulation.
OpenAI API: Drives the AI-powered financial suggestions. Users can get financial insights tailored to their budgeting habits.
Pandas: Used for data management and to read/write user data in Excel format.
os: To check and interact with the system's file paths.
Future Enhancements:
Transition to a web-based platform using Django as the backend framework.
Frontend development will leverage HTML, CSS, and Javascript for a dynamic user interface.
Implementation of a database system for securely storing user data.
Usage:

Run the Python script to access the app's menu. The options range from registration to getting AI-driven financial advice. Ensure you have a valid OpenAI API key to access AI features.

Note:

The project is still in its development phase, and any feedback or contribution is highly appreciated!
